# Generalized-Erdos-Straus-Conjecture
The Erdos-Straus Conjecture, introduced in 1948 asks if the expression, "4/n" can be expressed as a sum of three positive unit fractions. But we generalize the idea by generalising the idea to "can any fraction in the form "2k/n" be represented as a sum of "k+1" positive unit fractions. (where 'n>1') ".
