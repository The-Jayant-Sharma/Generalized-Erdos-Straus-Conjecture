# Generalized Erdős–Straus Conjecture

The **Erdős–Straus Conjecture**, introduced in 1948, asks whether the rational number  
$\frac{4}{n}$
can always be expressed as the sum of **three positive unit fractions** for every integer $n > 1$.

This project explores a **generalization** of that idea:

> **Can every rational number of the form**  
> $\frac{2k}{n}$  
> **be represented as the sum of $k+1$ positive unit fractions, for all integers $k \geq 1$ and $n > 1$?**

This generalized formulation seeks to extend the classical Egyptian fraction representation to a broader family of cases, offering new ground for number-theoretic exploration.

### Goals
- Investigate existence and construction algorithms for such representations.
- Explore bounds and exceptions, if any, in computational or theoretical settings.
- Analyze connections to Diophantine equations and additive number theory.
